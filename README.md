# Housing_Price_Prediction
Our project endeavors to predict housing prices through machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on housing in the Boston area. The housing dataset encompasses a diverse range of factors, including property taxes, crime rates, community attributes, and the number of rooms, all influencing housing values. By providing accurate forecasts, this initiative aims to empower investors, homeowners, and real estate agents with informed decision-making tools, enabling them to make more strategic investments and navigate the housing market with confidence.
